/**
 * Spawns alligators into four rows that move at different speeds.
 *
 * Each row gets its own spawn interval, inversely related to its speed
 * by DENSITY_BIAS_EXPONENT below. A single shared interval (as the
 * original AWT version used) makes the slow rows pile up badly: a fast
 * row clears itself almost as quickly as new alligators arrive, but a
 * slow one doesn't, so it keeps accumulating. Fully equalizing density
 * (every row ends up with the same count) fixes that but reads as too
 * uniform; the current exponent leaves slower rows moderately fuller
 * than faster ones without the original pile-up.
 *
 * Kept as per-session instance state (rather than the static globals
 * the original AWT version used) so a restarted game starts clean.
