/**
 * A single alligator crossing the screen from right to left.
 *
 * Positions (x, y) are in top-left-origin, Y-down screen space, matching
 * touch/mouse input coordinates and the original AWT version. LibGDX's
 * SpriteBatch is Y-up from the bottom-left by default, so draw() flips
 * Y itself rather than relying on a Y-down camera — BitmapFont's own
 * layout math assumes Y-up, so a Y-down camera would render text
 * upside down while leaving sprites looking correct, which is worse to
 * get subtly wrong than converting coordinates explicitly here.
 *
 * width/height are passed in rather than read from the texture here, so
 * this class stays constructible (and testable) without a real Texture.
